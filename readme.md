#Mobile Game App - Guess the Numnber

This is a mobile application made for my final exam in class of summer 2023. 
Here I used a recycler view to show the score board. If the user won, it would be true and vice versa.
This can be better presented and is a flaw, but it is a work in progress.
Room database is implemented in this application to store the score infromation.
